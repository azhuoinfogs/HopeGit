# memfs-fuse
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tniessen/memfs-fuse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tniessen/memfs-fuse)

This repository serves as a very simple example of a fuse filesystem.

## Building

[libfuse](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse) is required to build this project. You can either
build libfuse from source or download it using package managers (`apt-get install fuse libfuse-dev`
for APT).

Executing `make` will produce the binary `memfs`.

## Usage

At the moment, memfs comes with some limitations. Therefore, it is recommended to supply certain
options to fuse:

    memfs -s -o default_permissions -o auto_unmount $mountpoint

Basically, this enables permission checking in the kernel, ensures clean unmounting and disables
multithreading as memfs is not entirely thread-safe right now.

To unmount the filesystem, use

    fusermount -u $mountpoint

## Debugging

You can use the script `debug.sh` to execute the filesystem in the GNU debugger while printing
log messages generated by libfuse.
